The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it can sometimes produce unexpected results if the units of measurement are inconsistent or if the calculation involves division by zero. For example, using `width: calc(100% - 10px)` is fine, but `width: calc(100%/2)` will lead to unexpected behavior.  Another common mistake is using `calc()` with properties that aren't lengths or percentages, such as `font-size`.
